# BlogPress
_Angela's Rails Application_
A simple blog built with Ruby on Rails

#### Assignment 1
- Setup empty Rails project (make sure it's version 4.2 or more)
- Make sure that the project uses postgres database
- Create controller "home" that handles home and static pages
- Create a page "About" which has information about the tool (anything for now).
- Add your photo and information in the about page (link to external photo of you for now)
- Create a navigation bar that applies to all pages. The navigation bar must include links to "home" and "about" pages
- Put all of your code on GitHub
- Submit the Github link

#### Assignment 2
#####Build four of your main models: post, comment, category and contact (don't worry about associations yet, will add those later).

Here are a summary of suggested fields and validations (feel free to add to those)

`Post: title(required & unique), body
Comment: body (required & unique per blog post)
Category: title (required)
Contact: email, name, subject and message`
